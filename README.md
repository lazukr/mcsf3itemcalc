# Minecraft Skyfactory 3 Tiered Crafting Calculator

This tool was made out of frustration of having to figure out how many items I needed in order to craft a specific tier of solar panels from the Skyfactory 3 modpack. 

## Requirements

Since I wanted to put this on a server and not have to worry about it, it was built with Node.js. It should not be very hard to convert it into an offline webpage only though. I will add that in a later commit.

## Usage

### Basic Materials

The page shows a list of 'basic materials' that are intuitive in how you obtain it, hence they are called 'basic materials'. Do note that it does NOT mean that they do not require some sort of crafting. They are just stuff you should know how to craft.

### Craftable Materials

This is a list of materials that can be crafted. Click on any of them and they will show up on the 'Item selected' section.

### Item Required

This list out the original crafting recipe of the selected item.

### Basic Items Needed

This list out all the basic materials that is required to craft the item.
